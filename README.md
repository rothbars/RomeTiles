# Roman Colosseum Tiles
The tiles presented here are based on a 50-cm resolution JPEG aerial photograph from effgis found here on the [free sample section of their website](https://www.effigis.com/en/solutions/satellite-images/satellite-image-samples/). The satellite image was taken with the WorldView 2 satellite. This image was georeferenced in QGIS3 using the OpenStreetMap raster and was transformed into Google's Web Mercator EPSG:900913 projection. In total 48 tiles were produced, 12 tiles when the zoom is equal to 15 and another 36 when the zoom is at 16. These zooms were chosen due to the relatively small area covered over the image and zooming out further would make the Colosseum and surrounding gardens difficult to see. As the name suggests the geographic extent of these tiles cover the Roman Colosseum in downtown Rome, Italy and the surrounding gardens, walking paths, and city streets.
